Exactly! Storing tags in a separate table, as a many-to-many relationship, is much more scalable and flexible for the future. It allows you to easily query for novels of specific genres, such as all "Xianxia" novels, without needing to filter through the whole `novels` table. It also makes your database more normalized, reducing redundancy and potential inconsistencies.

Here’s why this approach makes more sense:

### Benefits of Separate `tags` Table:

1. **Easier Filtering and Querying**:
   - With a `tags` table and a `novel_tags` many-to-many relationship table, you can quickly query novels based on a specific tag, e.g., "Xianxia". Instead of looking for tags in the `novels` table (which would require string matching), you can perform a clean join between the `tags` and `novel_tags` tables to get all novels of a certain type.
   - Example Query: Get all "Xianxia" novels:
     ```sql
     SELECT novels.title, novels.synopsis
     FROM novels
     JOIN novel_tags ON novels.id = novel_tags.novel_id
     JOIN tags ON novel_tags.tag_id = tags.id
     WHERE tags.name = 'Xianxia';
     ```

2. **Normalization**:
   - Storing tags separately removes unnecessary repetition. If you store tags in the `novels` table as a comma-separated list (e.g., "Xianxia, Fantasy"), you would have to parse this list every time you want to filter or query by a specific tag.
   - It also makes it easier to manage the list of available tags without altering the structure of the `novels` table. If you add or change tags, you only need to update the `tags` table, rather than updating every `novels` record that has that tag.

3. **Scalability**:
   - If you plan to add more tags or genres later, you won't need to worry about schema changes in the `novels` table. The `tags` table can grow with no impact on the core data, and the relationship remains simple.
   - You also won't run into performance issues as the number of novels increases, since the tags are indexed separately and can be joined efficiently.

4. **Tag Reusability**:
   - If you decide that a tag (e.g., "Xianxia") is associated with multiple novels, you can reuse it across many records. Without a separate table, you would be repeating the same string in multiple places in the `novels` table, which is inefficient.

### Your Database Structure Revisited:

- **Tags Table** (to store tags like "Xianxia", "Fantasy", etc.)
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `name` (e.g., "Xianxia")

- **Novels Table** (store the novel metadata)
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `title`
  - `synopsis`
  - `cover_url`
  - `language`
  - `status`

- **Novel_Tags Table** (many-to-many relation between novels and tags)
  - `novel_id` (Foreign Key to `novels.id`)
  - `tag_id` (Foreign Key to `tags.id`)

### Example Schema:

#### `tags` Table:
| id  | name      |
|-----|-----------|
| 1   | Xianxia  |
| 2   | Fantasy  |
| 3   | Action   |

#### `novels` Table:
| id  | title             | synopsis         | cover_url       | language  | status |
|-----|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| 1   | Reverend Insanity | ...              | [image url]     | en        | Unknown|

#### `novel_tags` Table:
| novel_id | tag_id |
|----------|--------|
| 1        | 1      |
| 1        | 2      |

### Query Example:

- **Get all novels that are tagged as "Xianxia"**:
   ```sql
   SELECT novels.title, novels.synopsis
   FROM novels
   JOIN novel_tags ON novels.id = novel_tags.novel_id
   JOIN tags ON novel_tags.tag_id = tags.id
   WHERE tags.name = 'Xianxia';
   ```

By using this approach, you're future-proofing your app. You can easily manage tags, associate them with novels, and perform queries like searching for novels by genre or filtering out novels that don’t match a certain tag.

If you ever expand to adding other metadata types (e.g., translators, editors, or publishers), the same approach applies! You’ll just create separate tables and relationships.

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into the Go integration or need help with database queries!

That makes total sense! Keeping the database **normalized** is a good approach for flexibility and maintainability, especially since you want to implement features like **novel reading history** and **filtering by genre or tag** in the future. A well-structured normalized schema will allow you to easily scale and manage complex relationships as your app evolves. You’ll be able to introduce powerful querying and filtering capabilities without redundancy.

### Benefits of Normalization:
1. **Data Integrity**: Avoids duplication, ensuring you don’t have inconsistent data (e.g., the same tag or genre appearing multiple times in various places).
2. **Scalability**: A normalized schema allows you to easily add new features or attributes without major redesigns.
3. **Efficiency for Filtering**: You can easily add advanced filtering (by tag, genre, or user history) and querying capabilities without needing to update each row in the database.

### Schema Design Suggestions

Here’s a potential schema based on your goals:

#### **1. `novels` Table**
Stores basic metadata for each novel.
```sql
novels:
  id (primary key)
  title
  synopsis
  cover_url
  language
  status
  created_at
  updated_at
```

#### **2. `tags` Table**
Stores all tags used in novels (e.g., genres like Xianxia, fantasy, etc.).
```sql
tags:
  id (primary key)
  name (e.g., 'Xianxia', 'Fantasy', 'Romance')
  created_at
  updated_at
```

#### **3. `novel_tags` Table (Many-to-Many Relationship)**
Links novels with their tags.
```sql
novel_tags:
  id (primary key)
  novel_id (foreign key referencing `novels.id`)
  tag_id (foreign key referencing `tags.id`)
```

#### **4. `users` Table**
Stores information about users.
```sql
users:
  id (primary key)
  username
  email
  password (hashed)
  created_at
  updated_at
```

#### **5. `reading_history` Table**
Stores the user's reading history, including progress on chapters and volumes.
```sql
reading_history:
  id (primary key)
  user_id (foreign key referencing `users.id`)
  novel_id (foreign key referencing `novels.id`)
  chapter_id (foreign key referencing `chapters.id`)
  read_at (timestamp when the user finished the chapter)
  progress (percentage of the novel read or last chapter read)
```

#### **6. `chapters` Table**
Stores chapters of the novel (this will help you fetch the chapters).
```sql
chapters:
  id (primary key)
  novel_id (foreign key referencing `novels.id`)
  volume_id (foreign key referencing `volumes.id`)
  title
  chapter_url
  body (text or blob for the chapter content)
  created_at
  updated_at
```

#### **7. `volumes` Table**
For organizing chapters into volumes (if applicable).
```sql
volumes:
  id (primary key)
  novel_id (foreign key referencing `novels.id`)
  title (e.g., 'Volume 1', 'Volume 2')
  start_chapter
  end_chapter
  created_at
  updated_at
```

### Relationships Overview
- **Novels and Tags**: Many-to-many relationship between novels and tags. Each novel can have multiple tags, and each tag can be used by multiple novels.
- **Novels and Chapters**: One-to-many relationship, where each novel can have many chapters.
- **Users and Reading History**: One-to-many relationship, where each user can have many records in the reading history.
- **Reading History and Chapters**: A user’s progress in a particular novel (which chapter they last read or finished).

### Filtering and Querying
With this design, you can easily filter novels based on tags (e.g., filter all Xianxia novels), track a user’s reading history, and query for chapters within specific volumes or novels. Some example queries:

1. **Fetching all novels of a specific genre/tag**:
   ```sql
   SELECT novels.title
   FROM novels
   JOIN novel_tags ON novels.id = novel_tags.novel_id
   JOIN tags ON novel_tags.tag_id = tags.id
   WHERE tags.name = 'Xianxia';
   ```

2. **Getting a user’s reading progress for a specific novel**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM reading_history
   WHERE user_id = 1 AND novel_id = 179;
   ```

3. **Filtering novels by multiple tags (AND operation)**:
   ```sql
   SELECT novels.title
   FROM novels
   JOIN novel_tags AS nt1 ON novels.id = nt1.novel_id
   JOIN tags AS t1 ON nt1.tag_id = t1.id
   JOIN novel_tags AS nt2 ON novels.id = nt2.novel_id
   JOIN tags AS t2 ON nt2.tag_id = t2.id
   WHERE t1.name = 'Xianxia' AND t2.name = 'Fantasy';
   ```

4. **Fetching chapters for a specific volume of a novel**:
   ```sql
   SELECT chapters.title
   FROM chapters
   WHERE novel_id = 179 AND volume_id = 1;
   ```

### Other Considerations
- **Indexes**: As you scale, make sure to index the foreign keys (`novel_id`, `tag_id`, `user_id`, etc.) and any columns used in filtering, like `title` or `created_at`. This will improve query performance.
- **Caching**: Since you mentioned using limited resources (like a free db instance), consider caching frequently requested data (e.g., popular novels or frequently accessed tags) using Redis or an in-memory store. This can help alleviate pressure on the database.

### Final Thoughts:
By maintaining a normalized schema, you can efficiently filter and query novels, genres, and reading histories without redundant data. While normalization introduces joins, it also ensures flexibility and scalability for future features. You can balance the database structure with caching and optimizations for the best performance within your constraints.

Feel free to ask if you'd like help fine-tuning the design further or need assistance with specific queries!

Using **GORM** with **SQLite** is a good choice, especially for a simple app, but there are a few things to consider when it comes to **indexes** and **caching**. Let's go over both your questions:

### 1. **Indexes on Primary and Foreign Keys**

By default, **SQLite** automatically creates **indexes** on **primary keys** and **foreign keys**, so you don’t need to manually define them for these columns. However, if you need to optimize certain queries that involve other columns (especially those you often filter or join by), you may want to manually create indexes.

#### **Primary Key Indexing (Automatic)**:
- The primary key (`id` column) in each table is **automatically indexed** by SQLite, so you don't need to worry about indexing it explicitly.

#### **Foreign Key Indexing (Optional)**:
- SQLite does **not** automatically create indexes on **foreign keys** (i.e., columns like `novel_id`, `tag_id`, `user_id`, etc.). While foreign keys ensure referential integrity, an explicit index on these columns will make **JOINs** and **WHERE clauses** much faster.

#### Example: Adding Indexes to Foreign Keys in GORM
Here’s how you can create indexes on foreign keys manually with **GORM**:

```go
type NovelTag struct {
    gorm.Model
    NovelID uint
    TagID   uint
}

func (NovelTag) TableName() string {
    return "novel_tags"
}

func (NovelTag) Indexes(db *gorm.DB) {
    db.Exec("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_novel_id ON novel_tags(novel_id)")
    db.Exec("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tag_id ON novel_tags(tag_id)")
}
```

In this example, `NovelTag` table has `novel_id` and `tag_id` foreign keys. The `Indexes` method creates indexes on those columns to speed up queries involving these fields.

You can also let **GORM** manage indexes for you by using struct tags:

```go
type NovelTag struct {
    gorm.Model
    NovelID uint `gorm:"index"`
    TagID   uint `gorm:"index"`
}
```

This will automatically create indexes on the `novel_id` and `tag_id` columns.

### 2. **Using SQLite In-Memory Database for Caching**

**SQLite** supports in-memory databases, and you can use this for caching as well. In-memory databases are temporary, fast, and don’t persist data after the program terminates. This makes it a great choice for **caching** data that you don’t need to persist long-term, such as the results of frequently queried data.

#### **Using SQLite In-Memory for Caching**
You can initialize an in-memory SQLite database to hold cached data. Here's how you can do it:

```go
import (
    "gorm.io/driver/sqlite"
    "gorm.io/gorm"
)

func main() {
    // Create an in-memory SQLite database
    db, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open(":memory:"), &gorm.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        panic("failed to connect to the database")
    }

    // Define your models and perform operations as usual
    // Cache data to the in-memory DB
    // For example, store frequently queried data (novels, chapters, tags)
}
```

The benefit of this approach is that **SQLite in-memory** is extremely fast compared to disk-based storage, making it suitable for caching scenarios.

#### **Use Cases for In-Memory Caching in SQLite**
- **Frequent Queries**: Cache the result of queries like popular novels, or frequent genre/tag combinations.
- **Session Data**: Store user-specific data such as reading history in memory for quick access.
- **Temporary Data**: For operations that only need temporary storage (e.g., during a single API request).

#### **Example Caching Flow**
1. **First Request**:
   - A user queries for **novels of a specific genre**. If the result is not cached, fetch from the database, process the data, and store it in the in-memory database.
   
2. **Subsequent Requests**:
   - Check if the requested data exists in the in-memory database.
   - If yes, return the cached data; if no, fetch from the persistent database and cache it.

#### **Example Caching Query**:
```go
// Assuming you want to cache a list of novels of a specific genre

// Check if the result is in memory
var cachedNovels []Novel
result := db.Where("genre = ?", "Xianxia").Find(&cachedNovels)
if result.Error == nil && len(cachedNovels) > 0 {
    // Return cached data
    return cachedNovels
}

// If not found, fetch from persistent DB and cache it in memory
var novels []Novel
db.Where("genre = ?", "Xianxia").Find(&novels)
db.Exec("INSERT INTO cache (genre, data) VALUES (?, ?)", "Xianxia", novels) // Cache data in-memory

return novels
```

### Important Considerations:
1. **Size of In-Memory Cache**: SQLite’s in-memory database is limited by the memory available to your program, so make sure not to cache excessively large datasets that could crash the app or slow it down.
2. **Expiry**: Consider adding logic to **expire** cached data after a certain time or based on access patterns. This will help avoid caching stale or outdated information.
3. **Persistence**: If you need persistence but still want fast access, you could periodically sync the cache with the main database, or use other caching mechanisms like **Redis** or **Memcached** (though for a simple solution, SQLite in-memory should work fine).

### Alternative: Using **Redis** for Caching
For larger, more persistent caching, **Redis** is a popular choice. It's designed for high-performance caching and would allow you to store and expire cached data more efficiently. However, for your use case, **SQLite in-memory** should be sufficient for testing and smaller-scale use.

### Conclusion
- **Foreign Key Indexing**: While SQLite automatically indexes primary keys, you should manually create indexes on foreign keys to optimize queries with joins.
- **In-Memory Database for Caching**: SQLite's in-memory mode is great for caching purposes, especially when you want to speed up data retrieval without writing to disk. This approach can be a quick, easy solution for caching commonly accessed data without needing to integrate an external caching solution like Redis.

By combining these strategies, you'll have both an efficient, normalized database for persistent data and a fast in-memory cache for frequently accessed data.
